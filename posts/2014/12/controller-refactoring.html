      I'm not sure what that quote means but I want you to write code for bears like 
      Winnie-the-Pooh. If you don't know a lot about bears, you can also imagine yourself in
      two years after a 13-hours intercontinental flight. Someone taps you on the shoulder and
      you need to explain your code. You have 15 seconds.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Making Winnie-the-Pooh cry</h2>
    
    <p>
      In Ruby on Rails there are two often used <em>callback chains</em>. Controller filters and
      Active Record callbacks. Let's look at something ridiculous first.
    </p>
    
    <div class="sidenote">
      <p>
        For this example we assume our authors have names that split up in first and last name.
        In general you can't do this. If you don't believe me, read <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</a>. It takes about 5 minutes, and is totally worth it.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <pre><code>class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  after_initialize :set_full_name!
  attr_reader :full_name

private

  def set_full_name!
    @full_name = [first_name, last_name].join(' ')
  end
end</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      Hahaha, that's really weird! That's not how you define an accessor. I know, right?
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_full_name!

private

  def set_full_name!
    @author = Author.find(params[:id])
    @author_full_name = [@author.first_name, @author.last_name].join(' ')
  end
end</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      Pooh is weeping almost inaudibly. Almost… But we know how to cheer him up! We can just
      refactor this thing into an accessor.
    </p>
    
<pre><code>class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  def full_name
    [first_name, last_name].compact.join(' ')
  end
end</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      Once we realize that controllers and models are all just Ruby classes we can do the same
      thing in the controller. Action Pack even gives us the little gem
      <code><span class="function">helper_method</span></code> which allows us to turn the
      accessor to a helper that is usable in the view.
    </p>
    
<pre><code>class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :find_author, only: %i(show)

private

  def author_full_name
    [@author.first_name, @author.last_name].compact.join(' ')
  end
  helper_method :author_full_name
end</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      Pooh is happy again! And not just because he just ate a gallon of honey. Wait, why didn't
      we get rid of all the before filters?
    </p>
    
    <h2>A History Lesson</h2>
    
    <p>
      What is a web server, but a Series of Tubes? That's exactly what they thought at
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/filter.html">Apache</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When responding to an HTTP request you basically apply some input filters, then do some 
      content generation, and finally some output filtering. Input filters do things like character
      set conversions, internal redirects, parameter mangling. Output filters can deflate (zip).
      And SSL is nothing but an around filter.
    </p>
    
    <div class="sidenote">
      <p>
        The filter methods used to be called <code><span class="function">*_filter</span></code>,
        but the _filter parts has become _action.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Sounds familiar? Rails does the same with its
      <code><span class="function">*_action</span></code> methods. The principle is really clear
      and simple, and like anything it can be horribly misused.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      An we misused it to death. When we couldn't misuse it even more we moved all of this
      misuse to Rack modules. But that's a story for another day.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Doing the Thing Right</h2>
    
    <p>
      Here I do the smart writing thing and refer back to the quote from the first paragraph.
      Think before you do something. Or what was the quote again? I forgot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So what are we allowed to do from the controller callback chains? We're not a web server like
      Apache and our chain is basically just a list of methods to invoke. Let's just lay down
      some rules.
    </p>
    
    <h3>1. Set instance variables to make the controller more readable</h3>
    
    <p>
      The method should be called for ‘a lot of the actions’ and it should be something that
      clearly needs to be done before we can process the action. This means things like finding
      the resource being operated on in this controller: the
      <code><span class="class">Author</span></code> in an
      <code><span class="class">AuthorsController</span></code>. Another example is finding the
      authenticated user because it needs to be there for every action anyway.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Influence the render chain</h3>
    
    <p>
      Render a response from a filter to halt the rest of the render chain. In most cases you
      do this to implement authorization. When the authenticated user couldn't be found we send
      a <code>401</code> page. Maybe we can send <code>304 Not Modified</code> to save a lot of
      work being done in the action.
    </p>
    
    <h3>3. Keep branching in actions to a minimum</h3>
    
    <p>
      Imagine a controller where every action needs an author on a book resource. In one
      <code><span class="function">before_action’</span></code> we find the book. In another we
      make sure the book has an author, otherwise we redirect to the edit page.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>class AuthorsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :find_book, :ensure_author

private

  # Finds the book or raises an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound,
  # which renders a nice 404 Not Found.
  def find_book
    @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  end

  # Make sure there is an author and otherwise redirect to a
  # page where the author can be filled out
  def ensure_author
    unless @book.author
      redirect_to new_book_author_url(@book)
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
    
    <p>Finally, remember that rules may be broken, but only if you're willing to do jail time.</p>
